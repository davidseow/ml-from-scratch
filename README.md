# ML From Scratch: Number Predictor

This project demonstrates machine learning techniques for predicting numbers based on various patterns and previous values. The code is written from scratch, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries, to help understand the underlying algorithms and logic.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # or use Pipfile if available
   # activate your environment as needed
   ```
2. **Run the scripts**:
   You can run any of the Python scripts in the `number_predictor` directory to see different approaches to number prediction.
   ```bash
   python number_predictor/single_previous_number_prediction.py
   python number_predictor/multiple__previous_number_prediction.py
   python number_predictor/non_linear_pattern.py
   python number_predictor/non_linear_pattern_2.py
   ```

## Purpose

- To learn and demonstrate how basic machine learning models can be implemented from scratch.
- To experiment with different approaches to sequence and pattern prediction.
